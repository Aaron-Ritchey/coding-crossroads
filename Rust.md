## Name Origin
The name has a large [false etymology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/False_etymology) which originated by the language's designer. In fact, the language designer has [no idea](https://www.reddit.com/r/rust/comments/27jvdt/internet_archaeology_the_definitive_endall_source/) where it the name came from.

If you're looking for some actual wordplay trivia...
- Some Rust coders call themselves "*rustaceans*". ðŸ¦€
- The mascot happens to be a crab because crabs are **(c)rustaceans**.
- The mascot's name is "Ferris" because rust contains iron, making it a *ferrous* material.
