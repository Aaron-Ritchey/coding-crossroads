# Coding Rosetta Cookbook

This repository contains a collection of topics [I've](https://github.com/aaron-ritchey) learned as I've been practicing on [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com).

These notes are being shared to help friends (and maybe the occasional random visitor) learn new languages by connecting similar ideas.

Also, this repository is where I practice using the note-taking program [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md) and practice [personal knowledge management](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personal_knowledge_management).
