# Coding Crossroads
This repository contains a collection of topics [I've](https://github.com/aaron-ritchey) learned as I've been practicing on [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com).

These notes are being shared to help friends (and maybe the occasional random visitor) learn new languages by connecting similar ideas.

Also, this repository is where I practice using the note-taking program [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md) and practice [personal knowledge management](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personal_knowledge_management).

## Repo Improvement Tasks
- Decide if/when/how to let others contribute to this.
	- Decide how I want this repo to be different from others.
- Create an Acknowledgements section or page
	- People who inspired me to create this.
	- People who helped with this project.
	- This is not a
- Add an [epigram](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epigram) to each language and concept.
	- To show how witty, pretty, and bright I am.
- Set up a linter?
- Look into how to post this vault in GitHub with correct URLs.
## Clean-up Tasks
- find all multi-line code chunks and add language to first line
- combine `#concepts/string/frequency` with `#concepts/array/frequency`
- maybe add a "draft" tag both to remind me to clean it up and to let others know the information isn't reviewed for accuracy
