Both C# and [[Java]] have a lot of similarities. An entire note might someday be written here to point out the similarities and the differences.
## Name Origin
Since C# would be an upgrade to C++, the joke was to call it C++++, which can stylistically be displayed the ["sharp" musical symbol](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sharp_(music)) `â™¯` which can also be typed with the [number sign](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Number_sign) symbol`#` 

Incidentally, it might have been called `COOL` (C-like Object Oriented Language) except for trademark issues.

> "We looked seriously at keeping the name \[COOL] for the final product but it was just not feasible from a trademark perspective, as there were way too many cool things out there."

Decades later, Apple was able to acquire the naming rights for [[Swift]].
