#languages/PostgreSQL 

PostgreSQL feels similar to MySQL.

As of February 2024, I'm going through [LeetCode's SQL 50 Study Plan](https://leetcode.com/studyplan/top-sql-50/), so I'll learn what makes it different.

## Name Origin

The name is a mathematical pun.

PostgreSQL was originally called "Postgres", and was based on another database, "Ingres".

In mathematics, there is "Prefix notation", "**In**fix notation", and... "**Post**fix notation".

## Concepts
- [[PostgreSQL NULL]]
