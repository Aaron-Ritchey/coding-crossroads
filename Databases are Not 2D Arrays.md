**TODO:** explore more about this idea.

I once read a quote in a Stack Overflow discussion which said something to the effect of...

> Why would you to think of a database as a 2D array? Go back and read the manual.

> You can't get the "first column" of a table because there is no concept of "first column" in database queries. *Data within a database table isn't necessarily a two-dimensional array.* (Emphasis added.)
